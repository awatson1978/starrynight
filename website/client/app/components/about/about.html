    <h2>About The Name</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>
      Why 'StarryNight'?  Basically because it started out as a launcher for the Nightwatch testing framework, which was named after a Rembrandt painting.   I was looking for a piece of art that was go along with Meteor, Atmosphere, Nightwatch, and...  StarryNight was an obvious choice.

    <h2>History</h2>

    <p>
      StarryNight was originally a launcher for the Nightwatch testing framework.  Somewhere along the way it seemed like a good idea to copy test files into a user's application.  Then it seemed like a good idea to run those tests on a continuous integration server.  And if we could copy some tests files into the app, maybe it would be a good idea to be able to scaffold some application boilerplate into an app as well.  And then it just became a place to add all the tools and scripts that Meteor doesn't include by default.
